# SevenBooks
Joined project initiated by TeeJ

## Objectives
Trying to get to speaking terms with modern development. In the old days I developed for IBM MainFrame like systems using languages like C, Cobol, RPG (Report Programming Generator) and PL-1. Time has passed and things seem to have changed since then.
If I had to pick 7 languages to study then the roadmap would look something like:
(put one spare for redundundancy purposes, go might have to go while it is in the same realm as rust => need to check AWS and Azure compliance for Rust)
```bash
shelf2b
├── c
├── go
├── kotlin
├── lua
├── perl
├── python
├── R
└── rust

9 directories, 0 files
```
Looking at the structure of this repo generates a totally different list (snatched code from: [pragprog.com] (https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/)
```bash
.
├── clojure
├── erlang
├── haskell
├── io
├── prolog
├── ruby
└── scala

8 directories, 1 file
```
Although the language lists don't match up it will probably get me in touch with people using modern development technologies.
Currently the book club has over a thousand members, get me very curious about how this will develop . . . . . .
