# SevenBooks
Joined project initiated by TeeJ

## Objectives
Trying to get to speaking terms with modern development. In the old days I developed for IBM MainFrame like systems using languages like C, Cobol, RPG (Report Programming Generator) and PL-1. Time has passed and things seem to have changed since then.

From my perspective I would have preferred [rosetta] (https://nguyenthanhvuh.github.io/class-compilers/pa1.html) to guide us for its historically proven track record. 
And the seven languages of choice would have looked something like:
```bash
shelf2b
├── c
├── kotlin
├── lua
├── perl
├── python
├── R
└── rust (having go as a close second)

8 directories, 1 file
```
Looking at the structure of this repo generates a different list (snatched code from: [pragprog.com] (https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/)
```bash
shelfai
├── clojure
├── erlang
├── haskell
├── io
├── prolog
├── ruby
└── scala

8 directories, 1 file
```
Although the language lists don't match up it will probably get me in touch with people using modern development technologies.
Currently the book club has over a thousand members, get me very curious about how this will develop . . . . . . looking forward to the journey.
